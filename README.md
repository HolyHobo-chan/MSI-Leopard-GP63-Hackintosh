# MSI-Leopard-GP63-Hackintosh
My repository for my MSI Hackintosh, Running opencore 0.6.2. I have a clover build on r5120, it is admittedly bloated and does not work well. Both will run Mojave and Catalina. The OpenCore build will run Big Sur. This is still a WIP and will be updated overtime. Let me know if you have any questions!


Thanks to @MaLD0n from the InsanelyMac forums with helping with DSDT patches. Specifically with shutdown issues on opencore. And thanks to ErrorErrorError for the disabling GPU patch.

What to do:
1.  HDMI out. (Possible as HDMI is wired to the iGPU, display port not possible as it is wired to the dGPU.)

2.  Improvment on trackpad, (the latest version of voodooPS2Constroller works, but breaks the left and right click on the trackpad. Not sure how to fix this.)
