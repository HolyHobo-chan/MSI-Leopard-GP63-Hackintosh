# MSI-Leopard-GP63-Hackintosh
My repository for my MSI Hackintosh, Running opencore 0.6.2. I have a clover build on r5120, it is admitidly bloated and does not work well. Both will run Mojave and Catalina. The OpenCore build will run Big Sur. This is still a WIP and will be updated overtime. Let me know if you have any questions!


Thanks to @MaLD0n from the InsanelyMac forums with helping with DSDT patches. Specifically with shutdown issues on opencore.
