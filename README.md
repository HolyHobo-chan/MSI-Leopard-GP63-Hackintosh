# MSI-Leopard-GP63-Hackintosh
My repository for my MSI Hackintosh, Running opencore 0.6.2. I have a clover build on r5120, it is admittedly bloated and does not work well. Both will run Mojave and Catalina. The OpenCore build will run Big Sur. T̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶s̶t̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶a̶ ̶W̶I̶P̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶u̶p̶d̶a̶t̶e̶d̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶t̶i̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶L̶e̶t̶ ̶m̶e̶ ̶k̶n̶o̶w̶ ̶i̶f̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶q̶u̶e̶s̶t̶i̶o̶n̶s̶!̶ 

Update: Unfortunatly, I don't own this brand of laptop anymore and am unable to work more on it. You should still be able to use the opencore config.plst and USB map patches in your build though!


Thanks to @MaLD0n from the InsanelyMac forums with helping with DSDT patches. Specifically with shutdown issues on opencore. And thanks to ErrorErrorError for the disabling GPU patch.

Requires a new broadcom Wi-Fi card for full functionality of wifi/bluetooth/handoff

to do:

1.  Improvment on trackpad, (the latest version of voodooPS2Controller works, but breaks the left and right click on the trackpad. Not sure how to fix this.)

2. Fix dGPU coming back on after sleep. (You can tell that the GPU turns back on as the power button turns red.)
